# Native Mac Notifications
***This plugin only works on Mac OS*** 

This replaces the current RuneLite notifications with native mac notifications from the notification center.

## Developer notes
During development notifications will show that they come from Java. But will say RuneLite
in production since it is in a app bundle.

# If you get double RuneLite notifications
1. Open settings and type 'RuneLite'.
2. Click the gear.
3. Look under Notification Settings. Disable "Enable tray notifications"


#Special Thanks
This repo has taken the way [intellij-community](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-community) calls native notifications 
via Java.
